# Tinker

**Tinker** is an open-sourced Discord bot adapted from [Typical Developers’ Main Discord Bot](https://github.com/typical-developers/main-discord-bot). It was customized for our own community’s use while retaining the open-source spirit of the original project. The bot provides integration and functionality similar to the Typical Developers ecosystem, and can be freely extended or modified by others.

There is no external documentation — all necessary explanations can be found directly in the code. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
